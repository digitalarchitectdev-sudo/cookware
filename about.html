                <h2 id="about-company">About The Company</h2>
                <p>ONS Cookers has been operating since 1985. There are currently THREE offices, TWO WAREHOUSES, ONE factory, and around 100 employees. It is the DIRECTOR of the Indian pressure cooker market and has been exporting to nations on all six continents since 2020. Over 15 million cookware and pressure cookers have been sold by ONS globally. All ONS pressure cookers are listed by Underwriters Laboratories, an independent global agency that tests items for public safety. The Government of India has made it essential, beginning February 1, 2021, to register all Pressure Cookers manufactured and marketed in India with the Bureau of Indian Standards, often known as ISI. As a result, every pressure cooker we produce has both the ISI stamp and BIS certification.</p>
                <p>A lid that fits within is a characteristic of every ONS pressure cooker. Compared to traditional pressure cookers, this design is by nature safer. In order to open any ONS cooker, you must first lower the lid a little bit into the cooker's body. This cannot be done until the steam pressure within the cooker drops to a safe level. Like an aircraft door, ONS pressure cookers are therefore pressure-locked for safety!</p>
                <p>The ONS Company is renowned for consistently innovating its products and for never sacrificing quality. The ONS pressure cookers that millions of families use are the result of the most rigorous quality control, the best production techniques, the most careful material selection, and the most extensive research and development.</p>
                <p>Each cooker undergoes leak-proof testing. This, in conjunction with an excellent pressure- regulating mechanism, guarantees that ONS cooks the fastest. Individually packaged in a visually appealing full-color carton is each pressure cooker. Free instruction manuals and cookbooks are included with every pressure cooker. Every ONS pressure cooker is covered by a five-year warranty ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE. DON’T FORGET THE GST BILL FROM RETAILERS OR WHOLESELLERS.</p>

                        <p>An Indian businessman named Shri Bhagwan Das Gupta founded ONS Cookers in 1985 while working in marketing alongside his wife, Shri Shanti Devi Gupta. He was raised by a father with limited resources but unwavering, devout beliefs. He achieved prosperity early in life, but the partition of India changed his life forever. At the age of 47, he established ONS firm in 1984 with a capital of Rs. 10,000, having to start again in midlife. This firm is based on HIS YOUNGER SON Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta's selection of products, people, and values, the most essential of which are integrity, hard work, and customer satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Shri Bhagwan Das Gupta passed away in 2003.</p>
                        <p>AND HIS WIFE SHRI SHANTI DEVI GUPTA PASSED AWAY IN 2023.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta is the Current C.E.O. of ONS company.</p>

                        <p>In 1996, twelve years after starting the Company, Shri Bhagwan Das Gupta stood down and passed over administration to his son, Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta, who had launched the Company in 1984 as Vice-Chairman and Managing Director before becoming Chairman and Managing Director and CEO in 1996.</p>
                        <p>In addition to his extensive experience and knowledge in management, marketing, and advertising, the company benefited greatly from his knowledge of the cookware and pressure cooker industries. His inspired leadership has been the primary reason that the company has been at the forefront of customer welfare and communication through packaging, point-of-sale merchandising, and advertising.</p>
                        <p>During his term as Chairman of the Board, the company established one more office in India.</p>
                        <p>The company's sales expanded over time.</p>
                        <p>The Company has emerged victorious from a number of challenges, owing to his pioneering efforts and consumer attention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta adhered to the following principles: treating all artisans and suppliers equally; obtaining results by appropriate means; pursuing excellence; concentrating on the main business; exercising caution; being courageous, daring, and determined; doing the best one can; and leaving the rest to God.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Premlata Gupta became a managing director of ONS on January 31st, 2003. Mrs. Premlata received her B.com degree from the University of Delhi in 2000, where she studied commerce, finance, accounting, and business fundamentals, including economics, business law, and taxes. She is married to Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta, the C.E.O. of the Board of Directors. Her honorary contributions to the creation of instruction manuals and cookbooks, as well as to the testing and development of items in the ONS Test Kitchen, have been substantial for many years. She does not have any directorships in other companies.</p>
